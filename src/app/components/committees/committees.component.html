                                    Joining MUN was one of the most impactful decisions she would make. MUN has not

                                    equipped her with invaluable soft skills but also provided a sense of belonging

                                    growth, akin to a second family: a place where she found a sense of belonging in
                                    that common interest of striving to make a difference; a place in which she grew
                                    and
                                    watched the next generations grow too. Despite career challenges, MUN remains a
                                    constant source of inspiration and belonging. As she concludes her MUN journey
